TASK-PROJECT-MANAGER-SERVER 🚀

Clone repo from https://github.com/exe987/task-project-manager-server.

Requirements 📋

You must have nodejs installed for installing all the dependencies, Mongodb and Mongo DB compass.

From Node JS I have installed the packages that I used for the development of the project.

Instalation 🔧

Once the repo is cloned, through the console we go to the TASK-PROJECT-MANAGER-CLIENT directory and execute:

npm install

This will download all packages for project development. After it finishes downloading we execute:

npm run dev

The app will open at http://localhost:4000. In the .env file you will find the connection string to a Mongo DB cluster that I use for testing.
